// interface is a syntactical contract that defines the structure of an object. It specifies the properties
// and methods that an object should have, allowing for type-checking

/*  why use interface? 
   Type Safety: Interfaces provide a way to enforce type checking, reducing runtime errors by ensuring
    that objects conform to expected structures.

1.Code Readability: They improve code clarity by defining clear contracts for what an object should look like, 
making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the code.

2.Modularity: Interfaces promote modular design by allowing different parts of the code to communicate through 
defined structures, facilitating easier updates and changes.

3.Multiple Implementations: A class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for flexible designs and promoting
code reuse.
